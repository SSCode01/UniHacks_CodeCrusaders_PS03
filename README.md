ChaosClub ⚡
ChaosClub is a social engagement app built during a 24-hour hackathon.
It is designed to help friend groups stay active, connected, and entertained through daily prompts, mini games, and digital time capsules.

🧠 The Idea
Most friend groups start off very active, but over time chats become dry, interactions reduce, and meaningful memories get lost in long message histories.

We wanted to build something specifically for friend groups — not just another messaging app — but a space that keeps friendships fun, engaging, and memorable.

ChaosClub focuses on:

Playful interaction
Light roasting & fun prompts
Social gaming
Memory preservation

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend

Flutter
Backend

Django
Django REST Framework
JWT Authentication
Database

SQLite / PostgreSQL
🏗️ Project Structure
The application follows a simple client-server architecture:

Flutter handles UI and user interaction.
Django manages authentication, groups, prompts, voting logic, and capsule scheduling.
REST APIs connect frontend and backend.
🎯 Why We Built This
We noticed that most apps focus only on communication.
ChaosClub focuses on keeping the friendship dynamic alive.

Instead of scrolling endlessly, users actively participate, play, vote, and create future memories.

🚀 Future Improvements
If extended beyond the hackathon, we would like to add:

AI-based friendship insights
Group activity analytics
Better gamification system
Push notifications
Enhanced media storage
👨‍💻 Team
Built by a team of 4 developers (2 Flutter + 2 Django) during a 24-hour hackathon.

📌 Status
This project is a prototype built for demonstration and learning purposes.
